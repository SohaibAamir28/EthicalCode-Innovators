# Short Project Description
st.markdown("AI Guardian is an innovative application that promotes ethical online behavior and protects digital wellbeing. It actively detects and addresses toxic language, offers ethical insights, and empowers users to make responsible choices in their online interactions.")

# Main Content

# Instruction
st.markdown("## Instruction")
instruction = '''
Create a Python class called "ContentAnalyzer" with the following methods:
1. `detect_toxicity(text)`: This method takes a text input and returns a toxicity score, indicating the level of toxicity in the text. You can use the AI model and content analysis capabilities integrated with StableCode for this.

2. `ethical_insights(text)`: Implement this method to provide insights into the ethical implications of the given text. It should identify potential ethical concerns such as biased language, hate speech, or cyberbullying.

3. `content_warnings(text)`: Develop this method to issue content warnings when potentially harmful material is detected in the text. Allow users to choose whether to proceed or avoid such content.

4. `customizable_filters(preferences)`: Implement a feature that allows users to set their own ethical and safety preferences, which can influence the behavior of the content analysis.

**Note:** Due to resource limitations in this Colab environment and the substantial size of the StableCode machine learning model, running and deploying the model here is not feasible. Deploying such a model typically requires substantial computational resources and may incur significant costs.

To work with StableCode and similar large models, it is recommended to use dedicated cloud-based machine learning platforms or on-premises infrastructure with adequate computational power and memory capacity.

However, I can continue to assist with code, guidance, and insights related to the project's development, features, and implementation without running the resource-intensive model in this environment. Please feel free to ask any questions or request assistance in other aspects of the project.

If you have access to a more suitable environment for deploying the model or require specific assistance with deploying on a different platform, please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide guidance accordingly.
